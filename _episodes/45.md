## Recap of Trino in 2022

Highlights from the blog post [The rabbit reflects on Trino in 2022]({% post_url
2023-01-10-trino-2022-the-rabbit-reflects %}) touch upon various aspects.

## Release 407

Official highlights from Martin Traverso:

[Trino 407]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-407.html)

* Improved performance for highly selective queries.
* Improved performance when reading numeric, string and timestamp
  values from Parquet files.
* New `query` table function for full query pass-through in Cassandra.
* New `unregister_table` procedure in Delta Lake and Iceberg.
* Support for writing to the change data feed in Delta Lake.

Cole's comments:

* For our contributors, we added a new action to track and ping the developer
  relations team on stale pull requests to further prompt maintainers to take a
  look. This doesn't have any immediate impact on end users, but it'll improve
  the development and contribution process.
* A Kerberos fix for the Kudu connector should make using it much
  less of a headache on long-running Trino instances.
* There were some really sophisticated performance improvements
  that came from shifting default config values and adding some new
  ones, all of which took a whole lot of testing.

More detailed information is available in the release notes for
[Trino 407]({{site.url}}/docs/current/release/release-407.html).

## What is workflow orchestration?

Workflow orchestration refers to the process of coordinating and automating
complex sequence of operations known as workflows consisting of multiple
interdependent tasks. This involves designing and defining the workflow,
scheduling and executing the tasks, monitoring the progress and outcomes, and
handling any errors or exceptions that may arise. In the context of Trino, the
tasks are typically the processing of SQL queries on one or more Trino cluster
and other related systems to create a data pipeline or similar automation.

## Why do we need a workflow orchestration tool for building a data lake?

Building a data lake can involve many complex and interdependent data processing
tasks, which can be challenging to manage and scale without a workflow
orchestration tool. Sometimes we can consider tools like Trino at the center of 
the universe, and perhaps it would be easier to schedule SQL queries with a much
simpler tool. Most companies, however, require a larger variety of tasks to
build a data lake that interoperate on more than just running SQL on Trino. Even
if you primarily run Trino SQL scripts to run these jobs, it is better to have
an orchestration tool instead of managing all processes manually.

## What is Apache DolphinScheduler?

<img width="75%" src="/assets/episode/45/dolphin-scheduler.png">

Apache DolphinScheduler is an open-source, distributed workflow scheduling
platform designed to manage and execute batch jobs, data pipelines, and ETL
processes. DolphinScheduler enables users to create and manage consecutive jobs
run easily, including support for different types of tasks, such as SQL
statements, shell scripts, Spark jobs, Kubernetes deployments, and many others.
In short, it's a powerful and user-friendly workflow orchestration platform that
enables users to automate and manage their complex data processing tasks.

Read [this blog on Trino and Apache DolphinScheduler](https://blog.devgenius.io/dolphinscheduler-helps-trino-quickly-realize-the-integrated-data-construction-of-lake-and-warehouse-cde095b6573b)
to find out more.

### Does DolphinScheduler have any computing engine or storage layer?

DolphinScheduler is a powerful tool for managing and orchestrating data
processing workflows across a range of computing engines and storage systems,
but it does not provide its own computing or storage capabilities.

## What are the differences to other workflow orchestration systems?

Airflow is the incumbent de facto workload orchestrator. Many data engineers 
currently rely on Airflow to handle their workflow orchestration today so it
helps to understand DolphinScheduler's benefits in relation to Airflow. Both
Dolphin Scheduler and Airflow are designed to be scalable and highly available
to support large-scale distributed environments.

Airflow supports a wide range of third-party integrations, including popular
data processing frameworks such as Trino, Spark, and Flink, as well as with
cloud services such as AWS and Google Cloud. Dolphin Scheduler supports a
similar range of data processing frameworks and tools. This makes both platforms
suitable for managing diverse data processing tasks.

DolphinScheduler project believes that future data governance belongs to data
engineers and consumers alike and should not be centralized to a single team.
Product-focused engineering teams should have access to data and be able to
orchestrate workflows without the need for extensive coding skills.
DolphinScheduler uses a drag and drop web UI to create and manages workflows
while also providing programmatic access using tools like Python SDK and Open
API.

A positive feature of DolphinScheduler supporting users outside the data team
through a UI is that it offers robust security features. This includes
authentication, authorization, and data encryption, to ensure that users' data
and workflows are protected.

DolphinScheduler has relatively limited documentation and community support
since they are a newer project, but they are working hard to improve the 
developer experience and documentation.

## How does DolphinScheduler deal with failures?

Failure is an inevitable aspect of data workflow orchestration. The merits of
many of these orchestration tools come from how well they aid users in
responding to failures by monitoring health and notifying users when things go
wrong.

### Does DolphinScheduler have an alarm mechanism itself?

Apache DolphinScheduler supports user notifications as part of a workflow. This
mechanism is designed to help users monitor and manage their workflows more
effectively and respond quickly to any issues.

<img src="/assets/episode/45/alerts.png">

These alerts can be configured to notify users via email, SMS, or other
communication channels, and can include details such as the name of the
workflow, the name of the failed task, and the error message or stack trace
associated with the failure.

In addition to these configurable alerts, DolphinScheduler provides a dashboard
for monitoring the status and progress of workflows and tasks. It includes
real-time updates and visualizations of workflow performance and status. The
dashboard helps users quickly identify any issues or bottlenecks in their
workflows and take corrective action as needed.

## Demo of the episode: Creating a simple Trino workflow in DolphinScheduler

For this episodes' demo, we look at creating a workflow consisting of a Trino
query execution managed by a workflow in DolphinScheduler.

Run the demo by following 
[the steps listed](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started/tree/main/dolphinscheduler).

## PR of the episode: Improve performance of Parquet files

While we're on the topic of data lakes, we had several performance for Parquet
files in release 407 from contributor and maintainer, 
[@raunaqmorarka](https://github.com/raunaqmorarka). This change includes an
improvement on performance of reading Parquet files for
[decimal types](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/15713), 
[numeric types](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/15850), 
[string types](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/15923), 
[timestamp and boolean types](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/issues/15954).

While Trino has historically had better performance for the ORC format, the 
Parquet file type has grown drastically in popularity and so this is one of 
many examples of the improving support around Parquet files for data lakes.
