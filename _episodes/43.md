## Concept of the episode: Data caching and orchestration

Out of all those petabytes of data you store, only a small fraction of it is
creating business value for you today. When you scan the same data multiple
times and transfer it over the wire, you're wasting time, compute cycles, and
ultimately money. This gets worse when you're pulling data across regions or
clouds from disaggregate Trino clusters. In situations like these, caching
solutions can make a tremendous impact on the latency and cost of your queries.

### Trino without caching

There seems to be a sizeable portion of the community who aren't using a
caching solution. Not all workloads will really benefit from caching. If you
are performing more writes than reads, the cache will need to constantly be
invalidated before performing each read. If you are scanning all your data to
run daily migrations, you would not benefit from caching. However, one of the
most common use cases where Trino shines is interactive adhoc analytics. This 
type of querying is very fast in Trino, especially when using modern storage 
formats like Iceberg.

### Two types of caching

There are two types of caching used with Trino. The first type caches the
results of a common query or sub query to optimize performance for any query
that overlaps with predicates to obtain the cached results. 

The other type of query is object file caching. Rather than store the results of
the query, you are caching the files from a file or object store that are
scanned as part of the query.

In this episode, we will focus on the latter type of caching. This will apply to
connectors like Hive, Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi.

### Hive connector caching

Trino has an [embedded caching engine](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive-caching.html)
in the Hive connector. This is convenient as it ships with Trino, however, it 
does not work outside the Hive connector. The caching engine is 
[Rubix](https://github.com/qubole/rubix). While this system works for simple
Hive use cases, it fails to address use cases outside of Hive and hasn't been
maintained since 2020. There are many features missing like security features
and support for more compute engines. 

### What is Alluxio?

Alluxio is worldâ€™s first open source data orchestration technology for analytics
and AI for the cloud. It provides a common interface enabling computation
frameworks to connect to numerous storage systems through a common interface.
Alluxioâ€™s memory-first tiered architecture enables data access at speeds orders
of magnitude faster than existing solutions. Alluxio was originally developed at
Berkley Amp Labs, [and was originally called Tachyon](
https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014_socc_tachyon.pdf).
It was less focused on caching and data orchestration and more focused on
fault-tolerance via lineage and other techniques borrowed from Spark. 

Alluxio lies between data driven applications, such as Trino and Apache Spark,
and various persistent storage systems, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage,
HDFS, Ceph, and MinIO. Alluxio unifies the data stored in these different
storage systems, presenting unified client APIs and a global namespace to its
upper layer data driven applications.

</p>

Alluxio is commonly used as a distributed shared caching service so compute
engines talking to Alluxio can transparently cache frequently accessed data,
especially from remote locations, to provide in-memory I/O throughput. Alluxio
also enables unifying all data storage to a single namespace. This can make
things simpler if your data is stored across different systems, have data stored
in different regions, or stored across different clouds.

### What is data orchestration?

A data orchestration platform abstracts data access across storage systems,
virtualizes all the data, and presents the data via standardized APIs with
global namespace to data-driven applications. In the meantime, it should have
caching functionality to enable fast access to warm data. In summary, a data
orchestration platform provides data-driven applications data accessibility,
data locality, and data elasticity.

### Trino and Alluxio: Expedia use case

Expedia needed to have the ability to query cross cluster over different regions
while simplifying the interface to their local data sources.

## PR of the episode: Alluxio/alluxio PR 13000 Add a doc for Trino

[This episode's PR](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/13000) is actually
not located in a Trino repository. This PR comes from the Alluxio repository. It
happened in the wake of the rebranding from Presto to Trino. PRs like this
helped continue the Trino community as it grew awareness around the new name, as
well as, fixed any potential issues that occurred with the hasty renaming we had
to do.

This was submitted by Alluxio engineer, [David Zhu](https://github.com/yuzhu).
A huge thanks to David and his contributions to Trino as well!

## Demo of the episode: Running Trino on Alluxio

This demo of the episode, covers how to configure Alluxio to use write-through
caching to MinIO. This is done using the Iceberg connector with only one change
to the location property on the table from the Trino perspective.
